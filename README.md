This repository contains a collection of simple Java programs designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and functionalities for beginners. These programs are ideal for beginners who are starting to learn Java or for experienced programmers who want to revisit fundamental techniques.

### Getting Started
**Prerequisites:**
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Download and install the latest version of JDK from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
* **Text Editor or IDE:** You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write Java code. Some popular options include:
  * Notepad++ 
  * Visual Studio Code (recomemded)
  * Eclipse 
  * IntelliJ IDEA

**Running the Programs:**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired Java program file (e.g., `cd src/main/java-programs/Palindrome.java`).
3. Compile the program using the `javac` command followed by the program filename (e.g., `javac Palindrome.java`).
4. Run the compiled program using the `java` command followed by the class name (e.g., `java Palindrome`).
